# Medical-Image-Retrieval-System-for-Dermatological-Images

### Overview

This project presents a dermatological image retrieval system using Vision Transformer (ViT) with contrastive learning. We apply Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), K-Medoids, and K-Means clustering to improve image retrieval accuracy. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on ISIC 2017, ISIC 2019, and HAM10000 datasets.

### Features

1. Vision Transformer (ViT) for feature extraction.

2. Contrastive learning to enhance representation learning.

3. Three clustering techniques (Fuzzy C-Means, K-Medoids, K-Means) for efficient retrieval.

4. Evaluation metrics: Top-1 retrieval accuracy, FID, mAP, P@K, R@K.

5. t-SNE visualization of feature embeddings before and after clustering.

### Dataset

We use three benchmark datasets for dermatological image retrieval:

1. ISIC 2017

2. ISIC 2019

3. HAM10000

### Results

1. K-Medoids clustering provides the best retrieval accuracy on ISIC 2017.

2. Achieved state-of-the-art performance compared to previous works.

3. Visualizations include confusion matrix for top-1 retrieval, FID map, P@K, R@K plots, and t-SNE embeddings.

### Contributions

1. Feature extraction: Vision Transformer (ViT) + Contrastive Learning.

2. Clustering-based retrieval: FCM, K-Medoids, K-Means.

3. Performance evaluation: Multiple retrieval metrics and visualizations.
